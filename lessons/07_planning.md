# Lesson 07: DOM Challenge Project (planning)


## Context
* **Course:** Javascript Programming
* **Unit:** DOM (Document Object Model)
* **Main objective:** Be able to reverse-engineer the plan of an existing program.
* **Prior knowledge:** Students should have experience with:
  * JS fundamentals: strings, arrays, functions, conditionals, loops
  * DOM Basics
  * DOM Details
  * DOM Creating
  * DOM Iterating
  * DOM Events
  * DOM Inputs
* **Standard(s):** 9-12.CT.8: Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.


## Warmup

Ask the following questions in order to show students the value of planning as motivation for today's project preparation.
* **Why is it important to plan before working on a project?**
  * _Without a plan, it can be difficult to know the next step._
  * _Without a plan, you may have to backtrack and lose valuable time._
* **What kinds of things are important to include in a plan?**
  * _Pseudocode_
  * _A timeline of tasks_
  * _Delegation of partner responsibilities_


## Mini-lesson: **DOM Challenge (planning)**

### Overview of project:

For the next few days, we will be working on a project. You will have 10 pre-written projects to choose from. You will be able to see how the end-result should work, and your objective is to reverse-engineer the functionality using the concepts we have learned over the past 6 lessons. Each option also includes extensions if you finish early (or just want an extra challenge!).

### Options: 

| # | Difficulty (+extension) | Challenge |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| 1 | ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥) | Meme Generator |
| 2 | ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥) | Color Generator  |
| 3 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥) | Password Generator |
| 4 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥) | Review Cycler |
| 5 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥) | Menu Selector |
| 6 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥) | Magazine Message Speller |
| 7 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥) | Todo List |
| 8 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥) | Quizzer |
| 9 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥(ðŸ”¥) | Calculator |
| 10 | ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ | Keymasher |

Here is where to find 3 versions of the code for each program:
* [Starter code](../code/dom-challenge/starter-code)
* [Solutions](../code/dom-challenge/solutions)
* [Fully-functioning programs, solutions obfuscated (hidden)](../code/dom-challenge/solutions-hidden)
  * There is a [student-facing page](../code/dom-challenge/solutions-hidden/index.html) for easy browsing of these programs.

NOTE: the [characters](../code/dom-challenge/characters) folder contains all images needed for the **Magazine Message Speller** for all 3 versions of the code.


### Example of plan:

Here is an [example of a plan](../resources/example-plan.md).

## Activity

Distribute **Starter code** and **Fully-functioning programs, solutions obfuscated** to students in a repo via Github Classroom. After forming pairs/teams, students should create a `plan.md` file, which should include:

* Which challenge they will be working on
* Pseudocode
* Timeline of tasks, with responsibilities delegated
