# Tools

## [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io)

Students can use this web-based IDE to write their code. It provides a command line, file tree, text editor, and a server to preview their HTML files that include JS. If they [setup](https://github.com/hstatsep/ide50) their IDE with an SSH key, it is very simple to clone/push their work to/from Github.

In this unit, students will be using their IDE to write and test their code for all 6 lessons, as well as for their DOM Challenge Project.

## [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com)
Teachers can use this tool to distribute starter code, collect student code, and add comments to student via automatic pull requests. Github Classroom also allows students to make "teams" for a given assignment if students are working in groups.

In this unit, Github Classroom will be used for two repositories:
* A repository for the 6 mini-lessons containing all 6 tasks
* A repository for the DOM Challenge Project containing starter code and comments for all 10 options.

### Summary

Both of these tools provide an efficient means for distributing, editing, collecting, and providing feedback for all code.
