# currdev_unit_plan-jsdom

## High level description of unit content.
The unit will apply basic Javascript concepts to the DOM (document object model) of a webpage. This will allow students to write programs that give the user the ability to manipulate the page (HTML/CSS) by way of interactivity.

## Rationale for creating the unit.
In the previous year, software engineering students learned HTML/CSS, so they know how to make static pages. But with their new knowledge in basic JS, they are able to merge the two concepts together and see how JS can be used to make a webpage dynamic by way of the user's keyboard/mouse.

## Placement of unit in existing class/sequence.
Unit 1: basic JS (strings, arrays, conditionals, functions, loops, objects)
Unit 2: DOM
Unit 3: P5js
Year-long project: using a 3rd-party JS library

#### Note
I (Brian Mueller) am somewhat collaborating with Lyuba Fridman on this unit plan. We've both taught DOM lessons before, so we started collaborating. We have slight differences in our students' prior knowledge, etc. So we are going to continue to discuss and share thoughts & resources, but we will be developing our own unit plans with some overlap.
