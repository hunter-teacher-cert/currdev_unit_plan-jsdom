# Javascript DOM Unit
by Brian Mueller

-----

## General Overview
The unit will apply basic Javascript concepts to the DOM (document object model) of a webpage. This will allow students to write programs that give the user the ability to manipulate the page (HTML/CSS) by way of interactivity. This would fit into a class where students have prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and plain (vanilla) Javascript.

---

## Motivation for Unit
Students love making websites with HTML and CSS, but they are often hungry for interactivity. Plain JS is a prerequisite because students should know how JS works by itself, thus being able to apply it to the DOM, or p5.js, or one of many JS libraries. Knowing which syntax, concepts, and functions are built-in (as opposed to belonging to a library) is crucial to prevent confusion when navigating between JS tools.

## Standards Referenced
(select one of the standards sets reviewed in class (CSTA, NY, MA, RI), include a link and a brief explanation as to why you selected that set)

---

## Tools Used
As mentioned, students should have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS. The [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) is a great cloud-based IDE, but [repl.it](https://replit.com/) could also be used.
